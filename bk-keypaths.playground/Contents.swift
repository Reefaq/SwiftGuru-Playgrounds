/*:
 #### KeyPaths
 Key Paths allow you to reference a type's properties (including computed properties) without actually evaluating or computing them. We may say that KeyPaths are to properties what closures are to functions! They hold a reference to the property, which may be lazily evaluated. Before Swift 4, one could have simulated KeyPaths using closures
 A simple example for KeyPaths:

import Foundation
import XCTest

struct _Person {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}

let sachin = _Person(name: "Sachin Tendulkar", age: 47)

//: KeyPaths for the name and age properties
let namePath = \_Person.name
let agePath = \_Person.age

//: Using KeyPaths to access properties
print(sachin[keyPath: namePath])
print(sachin[keyPath: agePath])

/*:
 KeyPaths come handy in deeply nested structures. They can simply create a view of a deeply nested property.
