/*:
 #### Codable
 
 A Codable is a type that can convert itself into and out of an external represresentation. The best example of `external representation` is JSON. Converting a type to JSON and vice versa, is one of the most prominent problems in computer science today, thanks to the deep percolation of JSON. Programming languages play a big role in this context. Languages like JavaScript have semantics very closely coupled with JSON, making JSON processing a pleasurable experience. Other languages like Java make it not as pleasurable! Swift wants to make JSON processing type-safe and easy to use! The Codable interface along with JSONEncoder and JSONDecoder API are a joy to work with!

 ##### Encoding to JSON
 
Consider a simple struct type called `GitCommit` which represents a commit in git. We shall now convert values of this struct type to JSON, the key names in the output matching the property names of the type!

If `GitCommit` conforms to Encodable (you need not write any conformance code!), you can very easily encode this type to JSON

##### Decoding JSON to type
 
If `GitCommit` conforms to Decodable (again, no extra conformance code needed!), you may decode JSON to the `GitCommit` type.

##### Customizing key names
 
 Sometimes a key name in the incoming JSON may not match the property name in the struct type. We use the CodingKeys enum to provide the mapping between key names and property names. Sample JSON:
 
 {
    "author": "clattner",
    "message": "first commit",
    "date": "2017-07-14T20:51:42Z",
    "commit_hash": "ce1a76c081f4b0bb98a33d98e595db95c7a4c871"
